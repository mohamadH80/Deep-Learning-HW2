# Deep-Learning-HW2
The second homework of Deep Learning course at Sharif University of Technology

The fully-connected-networks.py is the implementation of fully-connected neural network.
It contains all details such as backpropagation, optimizers, dropout.
Q1 notebook file evaluate the implemented neural network. To see results, see that.


Q2 notebook is implementation of forward-forward algorithm and training a neural network on MNIST.
This algorithm has been explained in a paper from Mr.Geoffrey Hinton.
